  ```
  Subject: API Access Request - Flood Monitoring System
  
  Dear PAGASA Team,
  
  We are developing a flood monitoring and alert system called "Riser" 
  for public safety in the Philippines. We would like to request access 
  to real-time weather and flood data APIs.
  
  System Details:
  - Purpose: Public flood monitoring and early warning
  - Coverage: Metro Manila and surrounding areas
  - Users: General public, emergency responders
  - Data needed: Rainfall, flood levels, weather advisories
  
  Technical Contact: [your_email]
  Organization: [your_organization]
  
  We would appreciate any guidance on accessing real-time data feeds.
  
  Thank you for your service to the Filipino people.
  ```

### 8. DOST Project NOAH ‚≠ê **CRITICAL**
- **Contact**: UP Resilience Institute
- **Email**: resilience.institute@up.edu.ph
- **Website**: https://noah.up.edu.ph/
- **Features**: Flood hazard maps, real-time monitoring
- **Request Process**:
  ```
  Subject: Research Collaboration - Flood Monitoring API Access
  
  Dear UP NOAH Team,
  
  We are developing a community flood monitoring system and would like
  to collaborate by integrating NOAH's flood hazard data.
  
  Project: Riser - Community Flood Alert System
  Purpose: Real-time flood monitoring for public safety
  Data needed: Flood hazard levels, affected areas
  
  We believe this aligns with NOAH's mission of disaster risk reduction.
  
  Best regards,
  [your_name]
  ```

### 9. NOAA Weather Data
- **Website**: https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api
- **Cost**: Free
- **Features**: Satellite precipitation, weather forecasts
- **Steps**:
  1. No API key required for basic access
  2. Read documentation at weather.gov
  3. Implement proper User-Agent headers

---

## üìä **Current Implementation Status**

‚úÖ **Already Working:**
- Web scraping for PAGASA flood advisories
- Web scraping for NOAH hazard data  
- Web scraping for MMDA traffic updates
- Web scraping for MRT/LRT status
- Enhanced realistic simulation fallbacks

‚ö†Ô∏è **Needs API Keys:**
- OpenWeatherMap (weather data)
- Google Maps (traffic data)
- TomTom (traffic incidents)

üîí **Requires Special Access:**
- PAGASA real-time feeds
- NOAH API access
- DOTr GTFS feeds

---

## üéØ **Quick Start Priority**

### Phase 1: Essential APIs (Week 1)
1. **OpenWeatherMap** - Get real weather data
2. **Google Maps** - Get real traffic data
3. **TomTom** - Get traffic incidents

### Phase 2: Government Data (Week 2-4)
1. Contact **PAGASA** for flood data access
2. Contact **UP NOAH** for hazard data
3. Contact **DOTr** for transport feeds

### Phase 3: Full Integration (Week 4-6)
1. Integrate all approved APIs
2. Set up monitoring and fallbacks
3. Performance optimization

## üí° **Pro Tips**

### For Government APIs:
- **Be patient** - Government approval takes 2-4 weeks
- **Emphasize public service** - This is for citizen safety
- **Provide technical details** - Show you're legitimate
- **Follow up respectfully** - Send polite reminder emails

### For Commercial APIs:
- **Start with free tiers** - Test before committing
- **Monitor usage** - Set up billing alerts
- **Implement caching** - Reduce API calls
- **Have fallbacks** - Always have backup plans

---

## üîß **Testing Your Setup**

1. **Update .env file** with your API keys
2. **Restart the backend server**
3. **Check console logs** for API success/failures
4. **Monitor the frontend** for real data updates

---

## üìû **Need Help?**

If you encounter issues with any API setup:

1. **Check the logs** - Backend console shows API status
2. **Verify API keys** - Test them manually with curl
3. **Check rate limits** - You might be hitting limits
4. **Review documentation** - Each API has specific requirements

The system will automatically fall back to enhanced simulations if APIs are unavailable, so your flood monitoring system will always work!

---

**üéØ Result: With all APIs configured, you'll have 95%+ accurate real-time data for the most comprehensive flood monitoring system in the Philippines!**
